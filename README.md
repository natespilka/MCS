TOP and MCS are two directories that house the bulk of my coding work 
while a research assistant at Penn. The scripts generally restructure and 
analyze data. A description of each script is below. (soon to come)


MCS:

TOP:


1. There are likely misspellings in the comments. My deslyxia and reliance
    on spellcheck are culprits.
2. Scripts that are dated on the first of the month (e.g. 9/1/19) have been 
    created within that month/year - likely not on that exact day. 
3. I would like to edit my previous work (summer of 2018-spring 2019) since
    the code can be inefficient at times but I do not have the time for that
    and doing so hastily may result damage subsequent code. 
4. I began this operation with the "DDcode/DDcode2" scripts - mostly with
    the intent that someone else would be able to use the scripts but this 
    is unlikely to be the case.
5. This README seems to be a convinient place to journal my dark thoughts 
    and beliefs but I decide to keep that here instead: https://bit.ly/IqT6zt
6. "LEGEND" folders are a way to store old information/material that is outdated
    that I will likely not use but I do not want to throw away. Pascal 
    (acknowledged below) taught me this.

More to come...






acknowledgment:
- Pascal Wallisch: for introducing me to matlab and providing a strong 
    foundation from which to grow.
- Kanchana Jagannathan: for helping explain mri/matlab- & shell- 
    related content as well as helping me link my work here to my github.# UPenn_TOP-MCS
